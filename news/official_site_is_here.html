    <h1>The Official Site is here!</h1>
    <p>Yeah that's it.</p>
    <p>The official site is here. Obviously.</p>
    <p>You're on it LMAO.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So anyway, 1.1.0 is out. Second version of the Alien Update and I can explain what the hell I'm doin with this
        damn mod and it's updates LOL</p>

    <h2>How does this mod work?</h2>
    <p>So basically each major update <version>(X.0.0)</version> will be a full update with a title. But each minor
        update <version>(x.Y.0)</version> will just be additions to the major update, like game drops for the official
        game. Patch updates <version>(x.y.Z)</version> don't have any link to the major update, it could fix an issue
        with the first one, the previous one, maybe a fix to a minor update. Etc etc, a patch is a patch.</p>

    <br>
    <p>And that's all folks!</p>
